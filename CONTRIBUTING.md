# Bienvenue! Willkommen! Welcome! 

How nice of you to consider contributing to this project. There is not much to be
said about the form your contribution can take:

**"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law"**

## Caveat

The only caveat is, that your contribution, whether it is source code,
documentation, art work, or anything else, must be given freely to everybody else
under the terms of the [LICENSE](LICENSE) of this project.

If you are not happy with this please feel free to fork the project and form your
own Cabal promoting your own views or interests.

## Coding Guidelines, Style Guide, etc.

There aren't any.

Seriously.

You are aware that your contribution is public, that fellow contributors
do their best following their ideas and selecting the best practices for their needs
as they go along.

This software is written to be used in any way, even new and unforeseen ways. It seems
fitting that collaboration should be unrestricted to take any appropriate form. Sure,
the existing artifacts may serve as an example and the opinion of your peers matters,
but as Timothy Leary put it:

    "Admit it. You aren't like them. You're not even close. You may occasionally
    dress yourself up as one of them, watch the same mindless television shows as
    they do, maybe even eat the same fast food sometimes. But it seems that the
    more you try to fit in, the more you feel like an outsider, watching the “normal
    people” as they go about their automatic existences. [...] Who knows what you
    might learn from taking a chance on conversation with a stranger? Everyone
    carries a piece of the puzzle. Nobody comes into your life by mere coincidence.
    Trust your instincts. Do the unexpected. Find the others."


Hail Eris, All Hail Discordia,
